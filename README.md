# Testing-Assignment
The goal of this assignment was to write test cases using mockito and JUnit to ensure code coverage and to detect any bugs present in a "faulty" version of the codebase using some provided API documentation.

The codebase provided to write our tests was a "fully working" version of the code, which meant that we couldn't check to see if we covered the potential bugs through trial and error. 

All my work for this assignment is present in the test folder, `src/test/java/au/edu/sydney/pac/erp/client` and `src/test/java/au/edu/sydney/pac/erp/feaa`
